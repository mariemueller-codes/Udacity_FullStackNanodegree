			<!-- your favorite animal's description goes here -->
			<p id="normaltext">This animal is an airbreathing creature that have eight legs, jaws with fangs that generally inject venom and has a silk-spinning organ. Unlike other insects, spiders donâ€™t have antennae. Spider digests its food outside their body. After capturing its prey, it releases digestive enzymes from its intestinal tract and cover its prey. The enzymes break down the body, which allows the spider to suck up the liquid prey.
